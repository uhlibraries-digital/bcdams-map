### Preservation Guidelines

For archival projects, data in this field is automatically populated from the external documents field located in the resource record for the archival collection. The external documents are not automatically created in ArchivesSpace; the preservation administrator must add the Cedar preferred term and permalink to the resource record in ArchivesSpace.

For standard projects, data in this field is automatically populated from the `Collection Title or ARK Url` entered in the Carpenters “Items” tab.
